This project was the Capstone Project of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. The main work focused on document classification, and ran on IPython 2.7 of Anaconda2.2.0, uBuntu 64-bit.

The dataset was acquired from CMU Text Learning Group Data Archives: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/news20.html.

Instructions
In order to execute the programs, users need install Python 2.7, Scikit-learn package, Numpy package, Scipy package, Matplotlib package, Pandoc package and tensorflow in advance.

It's convenient to install Anaconda instead of installing those packages one by one.
